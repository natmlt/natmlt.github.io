    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here are photos of my latest pens.</p>

<p>This is Buckeye Burl. A stabilized pen blank. I was afraid it would be difficult to work with but it really did not seem any different then regular wood. Of course with all the worm holes it had a greater chance of breaking. I am pretty happy with how it turned out.</p>

<p>This is Olivewood. The blank came with a little certificate stating it was from the &ldquo;Holy land&rdquo; and they take special care when trimming the trees to promote growth and maintain health. I had never seen Olivewood before and was pleasantly surprised to see the beautiful grain. I also really like this particular pen kit. It is platinum plated and rollerball writes nicely. It will also take the Monteblanc refills if they are trimmed a bit.</p>
