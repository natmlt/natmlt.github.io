    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I have become quite interested in electronics. Beside my Rock Band hack I have been trying to figure out how to etch my own PCBs. I am sorry to say it has not been going very well. The process of transferring the design to the pcb has not been working. I tried regular photo paper like so may people recommend and then tried <a href="http://www.pulsarprofx.com/PCB/a_Pages/3_Direct_Etch/3b_The_15min_PCB/The_15min_PCB.html">Pulsar</a> transfer paper. The toner just floats away when I soak the paper off. I managed to get enough of the design to stick as a template and then I used the old fashion tape method. I had some traces that were not complete and solder wires across them. There is still some issue somewhere I have to track down as only a few LEDs are lighting. This project has just not been going well for some reason.
The Mooninite plans came from <a href="http://forums.linear1.org/index.php/topic,1307.0.html">here.</a>
