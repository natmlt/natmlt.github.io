I got my development project moved to cvsdude and have Trac setup now. The development is going pretty slowly but I am really glad I switch over to using the [Symfony](http://www.symfony-project.org/) framework. It has help speed up development a LOT! Last week I got sfGuard installed and working. Now if I could just get my speed at coding up. One hurdle is going to be getting my data to print out in a pivot table layout. I have not really gotten any ideas on how to tackle that yet.

If you are bored and have nothing better to do feel free to check out the little I have done.

---------------------
The above project link is no longer valid as the project is dead.  In fact the domain name I owned pject.com I gave to a student to use for a product so it is not even associated with me anymore.
