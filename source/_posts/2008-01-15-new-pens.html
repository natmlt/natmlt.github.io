<p>Here are photos of my latest pens.&nbsp; </p>

<p>This is Buckeye Burl.&nbsp; A stabilized pen blank.&nbsp; I was afraid it would be difficult to work with but it really did not seem any different then regular wood.&nbsp; Of course with all the worm holes it had a greater chance of breaking.&nbsp; I am pretty happy with how it turned out.</p>

</p><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><p>This is Olivewood.&nbsp; The blank came with a little certificate stating it was from the &quot;Holy land&quot; and they take special care when trimming the trees to promote growth and maintain health.&nbsp; I had never seen Olivewood before and was pleasantly surprised to see the beautiful grain.&nbsp; I also really like this particular pen kit.&nbsp; It is platinum plated and rollerball writes nicely.&nbsp; It will also take the Monteblanc refills if they are trimmed a bit.</p>
