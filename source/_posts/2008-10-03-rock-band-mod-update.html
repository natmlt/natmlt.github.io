<p>Just a quick update.&nbsp; I recently changed up my drum set a bit.&nbsp; I got myself a used Roland PD-120 to be my snare and a PD-80 for the high hat.&nbsp; I though the mesh pads would be even quieter and enhance my Rock Band experience.&nbsp; They really are not much quieter but the sound is different then the rubber thud.&nbsp; They actually kind of sound like a real drum that is just very muted.&nbsp; Another reason for getting the PD-120 was because it is bigger and I can use a snare stand with it.&nbsp; Since adding the double bass pedal my left knee would hit on the bar the Yamaha had for holding the snare.&nbsp; Now with snare on the stand that problem is gone.</p>

<p>I tried to make a video since that seems to be thing to do.&nbsp; It turned out pretty boring but if you are interested be my guest:</p>

One neat thing I discovered was using practice mode to play the full song but play the sound of the drums out the actual drum brain.&nbsp; It really surprised me how forgiving Rock Band is with your timing.&nbsp; Once you actually listen to yourself playing you can hear how off you can be and still have Rock Band trigger a hit.&nbsp; I really recommend if you have speakers hooked up to your drum brain trying practice mode.&nbsp; It is a cool way to get drumless tracks to play along with and improve your drum skills.</p>
