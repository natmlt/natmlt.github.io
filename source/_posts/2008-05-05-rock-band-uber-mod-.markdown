<p>After completing my pedal mod I kept reading about what other improvements could be made.&nbsp; I ended up deciding that a full blown electronic drum kit was required.&nbsp; After much deliberation I talked myself into dropping $700 on a Yamaha DTXplorer.&nbsp; Thanks to Flash for distilling 100+ pages of a <a href="http://www.rockband.com/forums/showthread.php?t=20420&amp;page=102">forum</a> thread into <a href="http://theflashspeaks.wordpress.com/2008/02/03/playing-rock-band-with-a-yamaha-dtxplorer-how-to/">this</a> site I was able to complete the mod.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Instead of soldering to the almost invisible points on the back of the RB circuit board I soldered directly to the button pads.&nbsp; Being careful to keep the wires as far to the outside and a flat as possible kept the buttons working like usual.&nbsp; I also used the USB power to run the MSA to avoid having another power brick.</p>

<p>I think the controller box turned out pretty well.&nbsp; Playing on the real
drum pads made a huge difference in response.&nbsp; The base pedal being
piezo instead of a reed relay makes it require much less movement to
trigger.&nbsp; I have been trying to play the songs using the proper cymbals
and toms with required me to go back to medium difficulty for a couple
of days.&nbsp; I am back to doing mostly hard now with a couple of songs
completed on expert.&nbsp; Overall it has been a very cool experience.&nbsp; It
is my first major hack and now that it is done I have to find something else
to hack!</p>

<p>UPDATE - 5/22/05</p>

<p>Now that it has been a few week my skills are to back to where they were from before the hack.&nbsp; Playing on a real set is so much better.&nbsp; I really like that I have the ability to use the right pad for the right sound.&nbsp; I saw that Guitar Hero is going to have cymbals and I think Rock Band should have done that to start with.&nbsp; I wish I could say I was rocking on expert all the time but I just cant get my kick speed up.&nbsp; I might just have to add a double bass pedal. </p>



<p>I finally decided to open the box and post pictures.<br /><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=800,height=600,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="images/small/pict2284_2.jpg"><img width="600" height="450" border="0" src="images/orig/pict2284_2.jpg" title="Pict2284_2" alt="Pict2284_2" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" /></a></p>
<p>
I bought the MSA disassembled.&nbsp; That was a lot of soldering!
</p>

<p><a href="images/small/pict2281.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=800,height=600,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="600" height="450" border="0" alt="Pict2281" title="Pict2281" src="images/orig/pict2281.jpg" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" /></a>
</p>
<p>I could not get the wire to stick to the points that Flash listed on his site so I decided to use the buttons.&nbsp; The buttons still work and I can use the drum pads for navigation.<br />
</p>
<p><a href="images/small/pict2283.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=800,height=600,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="600" height="450" border="0" alt="Pict2283" title="Pict2283" src="images/orig/pict2283.jpg" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" /></a>
</p>

<p>
I used the usb power to run the MSA.&nbsp; The red is positive and the black is ground.</p>


<p><a href="images/small/pict2287.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=800,height=600,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="600" height="450" border="0" alt="Pict2287" title="Pict2287" src="images/orig/pict2287.jpg" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" /></a>
</p>

<p>I dremeled the original Rock Band drum controller down and then epoxied into the project box.</p>
