After completing my pedal mod I kept reading about what other improvements could be made.  I ended up deciding that a full blown electronic drum kit was required. After much deliberation I talked myself into dropping $700 on a Yamaha DTXplorer.  Thanks to Flash for distilling 100+ pages of a [forum](http://www.rockband.com/forums/showthread.php?t=20420&amp;page=102) thread into [this](http://theflashspeaks.wordpress.com/2008/02/03/playing-rock-band-with-a-yamaha-dtxplorer-how-to/) site I was able to complete the mod.

Instead of soldering to the almost invisible points on the back of the RB circuit board I soldered directly to the button pads.  Being careful to keep the wires as far to the outside and a flat as possible kept the buttons working like usual.  I also used the USB power to run the MSA to avoid having another power brick.

I think the controller box turned out pretty well.  Playing on the real
drum pads made a huge difference in response.  The base pedal being
piezo instead of a reed relay makes it require much less movement to
trigger.  I have been trying to play the songs using the proper cymbals
and toms with required me to go back to medium difficulty for a couple
of days.  I am back to doing mostly hard now with a couple of songs
completed on expert.  Overall it has been a very cool experience.  It
is my first major hack and now that it is done I have to find something else
to hack!

Now that it has been a few week my skills are to back to where they were from before the hack.  Playing on a real set is so much better.  I really like that I have the ability to use the right pad for the right sound.  I saw that Guitar Hero is going to have cymbals and I think Rock Band should have done that to start with.  I wish I could say I was rocking on expert all the time but I just cant get my kick speed up.  I might just have to add a double bass pedal.


I finally decided to open the box and post pictures.<br />

I bought the MSA disassembled.  That was a lot of soldering!

I could not get the wire to stick to the points that Flash listed on his site so I decided to use the buttons.  The buttons still work and I can use the drum pads for navigation.<br />

I used the usb power to run the MSA.  The red is positive and the black is ground.

I dremeled the original Rock Band drum controller down and then epoxied into the project box.
