The bass pedal that comes with Rock Band is not the nicest piece of hardware. This weekend I finished a mod I found on [rockband.scorehero.com](http://rockband.scorehero.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=1038&amp;sid=635a98f3a42f22be54ac8fe68807cffe) to replace the pedal with a real bass drum pedal. I used a reed relay and magnets from Radio Shack to get the Pearl pedal connected. What an amazing difference! No more leg fatigue and much faster response. I urge anyone who really enjoys drumming on Rock Band to make the change.

I am still in the process of building a switch that will allow me to use both the new pedal and the original at the same time. The schematic [here](http://rockband.scorehero.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=3428&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=15) is what I am using. I just need to get it off the breadboard and permanently soldered.
