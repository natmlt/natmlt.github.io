<p>I got my development project moved to cvsdude and have Trac setup now.&nbsp; The development is going pretty slowly but I am really glad I switch over to using the <a href="http://www.symfony-project.org/">Symfony</a> framework.&nbsp; It has help speed up development a LOT!&nbsp; Last week I got sfGuard installed and working.&nbsp; Now if I could just get my speed at coding up.&nbsp; One hurdle is going to be getting my data to print out in a pivot table layout.&nbsp; I have not really gotten any ideas on how to tackle that yet.</p>

<p>If you are bored and have nothing better to do feel free to check out the little I have done.&nbsp; </p>
