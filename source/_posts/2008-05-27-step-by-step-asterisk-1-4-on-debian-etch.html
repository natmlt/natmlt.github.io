<p>For the past 3 years I have been using Asterisk as a consultant for other companies and for more than a year running it in my own hosted PBX company.&nbsp; My relationship with Asterisk is a love/hate.&nbsp; It is amazingly configurable but with that comes the complexity of having to configure everything.&nbsp; I don't find the built-in scripting language very intuitive.&nbsp; </p>
